This is a branch of the official [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) application with domain & persistence layer built with [Spring Data JDBC](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jdbc/) instead of [Spring Data JPA](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/).

Additionally:

- uses [TestContainers](http://testcontainers.org/) to spin up MySQL during integtation tests

Check original project [readme](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/blob/master/readme.md) for introduction the project, how to run, and how to contribute.

## Interesting Spring Petclinic forks

The Spring Petclinic master branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

This [spring-petclinic-data-jdbc](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-data-jdbc) project is one of the [several forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) 
hosted in a special GitHub org: [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic).
If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.
